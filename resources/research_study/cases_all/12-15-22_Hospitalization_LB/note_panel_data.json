The patient's current symptomatology began last friday [**12-12**] when she developed URI symptoms including nasal congestion and cough. Since then she has noted increased dyspnea, increased episodes of her anginal pain including at rest and cough productive of yellow/celery colored sputum.  Dyspnea has increased to point where she has trouble with stairs now where recently she has not.  Has dry cough at baseline attributed to Mavik, but her current cough is different.  Has also had significantly increased fatigue over this time.  Takes combivent or albuterol with some relief of shortness of breath.  Her SOB brought her to see her PCP, **Paul Lanbeck**. CXR was obtained and revealed no acute process. Other history from that visit is unobtainable. Last night she had palpitations and her shortness of breath subsequently worsened which ultimately brought her to **Mercy Hospital** today. \n\n Reports taking all her medications.

Native three vessel coronary artery disease with extensive bridging collaterals of the RCA.\n 2. Known occluded saphenous vein grafts.\n 3. Patent LIMA to LAD.\n 4. Patent left subclavian stent.\n 5. Mild mitral regurgitation.\n 6. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.\n 7. Mild right common-femoral vascular disease.\n COMMENTS:\n 1. Coronary arteriography in this right dominant system showed native three-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild luminal irregularities. The LAD artery was occluded in the mid-vessel. The left circumflex artery was proximally occluded with two distal OMs with a 'jump' segment filling via left to left collaterals. The RCA was proximally occluded with many bridging collaterals supplying the distal RCA and posterior LV branches.\n 2. Saphenous vein grafts were known to be occluded from a prior catheterization dated [**6-17**] and were therefore not visualized.\n 3. Graft angiography showed a widely patent LIMA to LAD, supplying the distal [**1-18**] of the LAD and large collaterals to the RCA and r-PDA.\n 4. Left subclavian angiography showed a widely patent left subclavian stent.\n 5. Resting hemodynamics showed normal left-sided filling pressure.\n 6. Left ventriculography showed mild global hypokinesis with more pronounced hypokinesis of the inferior wall. There was trace mitral regurgitation. The calculated LVEF was 45%.\n 7. Limited left ilio-femoral peripheral angiography showed a mild 30% stenosis of the common femoral artery.\n\nEKG: afib, left axis deviation, ST depression and TWI in V2-V6.\n\n\n[**12-19**] Echo:\n\nStudy continues from Tape [**2022**] W487 to tape [**2022**] W 509, starting at 0:15 for an additional seven minutes of recording.\nLEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.\nRIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Depressed LVEF. Cannot assess LVEF.\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.\nAORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.\nAORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.\nMITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.\n\nGENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.\n 2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed. Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.\n 3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)\nmitral regurgitation is seen.\n 4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n\n[**12-26**] cath:\nPROCEDURE DATE: [**2022-12-26**] INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:\n - EKG changes.\n\n FINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.\n 2. Patent LIMA-LAD\n \n COMMENTS:\n 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel disease. The LMCA was diffusely disease. The LAD was occluded mid-vessel and filled distally via the LIMA. The LCX was occluded proximally, and filled distally from collaterals from the LCX. The RCA was occluded proximally and filled distally via bridging collaterals.\n 2. Graft angiography revealed a patent LIMA-LAD. The SVGs were not imaged as they were known to be occluded.\n 3. Left ventriculography was not performed.\n 4. The left subclavian stent was widely patent.\n\nLIVER OR GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND. INDICATION: 74 year old female with abdominal pain, increased LFTs. Evaluate for gallstones, or liver disease. There are no prior studies for comparison. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The common bile duct measures 5 mm, and is within normal limits status post cholecystectomy. The liver shows no focal abnormalities. The liver parenchyma is mildly hyperechoic in echotexture, consistent with fatty infiltration. The right kidney measures 8.3 cm. There is a mild hyperechoic focus within the interpolar right kidney, with no evidence of posterior shadowing, possibly representing a small parenchymal calcification. Within the lateral aspect of the right kidney, in the interpolar region, there is a 1.2-cm anechoic focus, most likely representing a simple cyst. The left kidney measures 8.1 cm, with no focal abnormalities.\nIMPRESSION:\n 1. Patient is status post cholecystectomy.\n 2. The liver is echogenic, consistent with fatty liver. However, other forms of liver disease, and more advanced liver disease, including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.\n\n[**12-24**] chest x-ray:\nINDICATION: Shortness of breath, s/p extubation. Check status.\nFINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright image. Comparison study dated[**2022-12-21**]. The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement. There is evidence of a prior CABG procedure. A vascular stent is noted in the left brachiocephalic vessel. The pulmonary vessels are normal. No pulmonary infiltrates are seen. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and slight widening of the minor fissure consistent with a small effusion. The hila and mediastinum are otherwise unremarkable. The ETT and the NG line remain well positioned.\nIMPRESSION: Possible small right pleural effusion. No other acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Prior CABG surgery noted and prior left brachiocephalic stent in place.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course: 72 year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG in [**2129**], stent to left subclavian in [**6-17**], re-cath in 02 as above, history of CHF, depressed EF, hypertension, afib astham/COPD who presents now with increasing SOB and anginal episodes after URI last Friday.\nCardiovascular:\n 1. ischemia: Concerning past history, very high risk and now with good story for unstable angina **Barbara** admit. Patient was ruled out for MI on admission. After stabilization of her pulmonary issues, given her history and an echo which could not fully assess LVEF and could not rule out RWMA, she went for cardiac catherterization and found to have no new lesions, patent LIMA to LAD. Patient maintained on ACE, beta-blocker, statin, aspirin, imdur. Imdur and beta-blocker titrated up.  D/ced calcium channel blocker with likely systolic dysfunction and definite diastolic CHF. Sublingual nitro as needed. Had been on Mavik for unclear reason, tolerating ACE here--would titrate up for heart failure as below. Continues to have some angina with stress.\n 2. pump: Patient noted to have depressed EF in past-35%? but no recent echo on admission. Echo here showed:\n - 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.\n - 2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed. Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.\n - 3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.\n - 4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On admission, the patient was felt to be euvolemic to slightly volume overloaded and gently diuresed but her SOB was primarily due to astham/copd exacerbation. AFter transfer to ICU(see\nbelow) patient received lots of fluids and needed to be diuresed. Diuresed adequately for discharge--felt to be dry for discharge by exam and labs. Given that she was acutely decompensated from pulmonary perspective and volume overloaded when echo was done, it was not felt to be fully accurate of baseline status. Maintained on beta-blocker, ACE for ischemia and HF. Should titrate ACE/beta to HF goals based on repeat echo (lisinopril 20/toprol 150).\n 3. rhythm; afib: has always been rate controlled, never cardioverted. Poor control now and had sensation of palpitations on night PTA. Unclear if ratelead to CHF or CHF lead to increased rate and component of ischemia?--Increaed demand leading to ischemia vs. ischemia leading to tachy. Patient maintained on metoprolol for rate control with good affect. Had been on dilt but with heart failure, systolic-held and went up on beta-blocker for control. Concerning anti-coagulation, we are holding coumadin until patient has outpatient colonoscopy-had guiac positive stools and crit drop (also with neck hematoma after central line placement.) Scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy and then to re-start coumadin then.\nShortness of breath/hypoxemia: CHF vs. post URI Reactive airways disease vs. COPD vs. PE vs. pneumonia--ON admission, SOB felt secondary to astham exacerbation-Patient acutely decompensated, wheezy on exam, sent to unit on day 2 of admission for intubation. Treated with predniesone, flovent, azithromycin then levaquin as well as nebs/inhalers. Had 5 day ICU stay and then was transferred out. By discharge, not wheezy satting well on room air. Felt to be RAD post bronchitis. Was not fluid overloaded on admit--was diuresed after ICU stay with lots of fluids. On discharge satting well on room air.\n Anemia at baseline/Crit drop/guiaic positive: Patient had crit drop while in ICU. She had a hematoma after central line placement as well as guiac positive stools. Was on heparin during this time for her afib, stopped at this time. She stabilized after transfusion in ICU, and needed no further transfusions. Neck hematoma is resolving. Guiac positive stools-she is scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy. Re-address anti-coagulation for afib after this. Do not want her on iron until after colonoscopy. \nElevated LFT's, tbili and PTT: After being off heparin (on it for afib), stopped for crit drop in ** Barbara Anderson** PTT remained\nelevated. WAs on subcu heparin, lft's obtained which showed mild transaminase elevation and t bili elevation.  Subcu heparin stopped, RUQ U/S obtained showed fatty liver/h/ocholecystectomy.  Lft's, t. bili and PTT trended down on discharge. Patient will need follow -up of these studies as an outpatient. MEd affect. Lipitor was increased from 10 to 40 given significant coronary disease--although unlikely to cause acute elevations.\n\nHistory of DM: Not on meds prior to admission.  Needs primary care follow-up.\nHypothyroidism: Levoxyl continued, TSH normal\nGERD: PRotonix continued, no acute issues.\nGeneral care: VIT D, calcium, multi-vitamins.\nMedications on Admission:\n - cardizem 120\n - levoxyl 75\n - warfarin 1/2/2 3 day rotation\n - protonix 40\n - lipitor 10\n - HCTZ 25\n - Imdur 45\n - metoprolol 12.5\n - Mavick O.5 \n - multi-vitmain\n - citrate\n - ferrous gluconate\n - aspirin 81\n\nDischarge Disposition: Extended Care Facility: **Boston Care**\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n - newly depressed EF\n - systolic Heart failure\n - acute renal failure\n - hypercoagulability\n - neck hematoma\n - cad\n - diabetes\n - reactive airway disease s/p bronchitis\n - transaminitis\n\nDischarge Condition: stable, ambulating with assistance\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n - Weigh yourself every morning, if weight > 3 lbs.\n - Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet\n - Fluid Restriction: 2l\n - Call your doctor if you experience any further chest pain, shortness of breath.\n - All medications as prescribed.\n - You will need to follow up with Dr. **Graham Knowles** and Dr. **Anika Mendez** this week. Please call to make appointments. They will decide about re-starting coumadin after you [**1-7**] colonscopy. Will also need to have PT/PTT checked at that time.\n - Please check ast, alt, alk phos and total bilirubin every few days and trend results. If increasing dramatically then contact **Pierce McGuckin** MD for further work up.\n - Outpatient doctor to re-institute coumadin over next few weeks.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\n - Contact Dr. **Hector Stern** within one week. Provider: **Telephone/Fax 878-415-2157**\n - Follow-up appointment should be in 1 week Call Dr.**Hector Stern** this week to set up appointment. \n - Need to repeat echo in 3 months.\n - You are scheduled for colonscopy on [**1-7**].\n\n\n",
